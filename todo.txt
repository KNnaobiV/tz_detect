1. Complete writing argparse
2. Test with utc data. All the test done so far has been without UTC data.
	You can convert one of the test data to UTC tz by subtracting the 
	appropraite amount of delta from it and localizing
3. Test with multiple years worth of data.
	Concat two of the csv files and use get some common years
4. Test the output format with timezones to the left of UTC

Algorithm
Open two csv files as dfs
Get common years
Get common weeks for common years

For the common weeks in the common years:
	Find the difference for float columns
	Get the absolutely largest values for these columns
	Get the time difference at corresponding locations if their values are close
	Get the mode of the time differences.
